# Background 

GINA receives data from a variety of polar orbiting satellite sensors over Alaska and generates a wide variety of products.  These products provide surveillance of current weather over Alaska is a vital part of the National Weather Service (NWS) forecast process, the availability of more satellite passes at an increasing number of wavelengths, as well as more multispectral products that combine several bands into single products, is a considerable advantage to the NWS forecaster in Alaska.  However, simply making these new tools available is only the first step—training is also needed to facilitate the adoption of these new products into the forecast process.  Figure 3 is an AWIPS screen capture from the NWS office in Fairbanks—with the exception of the 0.64µm imagery in the upper-left panel of this screen capture, this figure contains imagery that until recently was unfamiliar to many forecasters.

Emulating the successful Quick Guides written by the Short-term Prediction and Research Center (SPoRT) and the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) Fact Sheets developed by the GOES-R program, GINA produced an intial series of ten Quick Guides (table 1) with the intent of familiarizing NWS meteorologists in Alaska with the very basic characteristics of these new resources and how they can be used to address Alaska’s forecast challenges.  At only two pages long, a Quick Guide cannot deliver in-depth training.  That said, Quick Guides serve as ready references on the forecast desk and are concise enough to be used quickly during a busy forecast shift.   GINA plans to develop additional Quick Guides in the future, with the goal that every GINA satellite product available in AWIPS at Alaska’s NWS field offices will have its corresponding Quick Guide.
